- **Features**:  
  Loan amount, term, income, debt-to-income ratio, occupancy type, loan purpose, and state code
- **Preprocessing**:  
  Outlier filtering, normalization, label encoding, and class imbalance handling
- **Deployment**:  
  Served via REST API with threshold-tuned binary classification
